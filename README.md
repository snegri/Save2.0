Goal of Save2.0:
Essentailly the goal of this project was to rework the Save statistic in professional baseball to be more accureate and usable for people analyzing baseball. 

Background:
The MLB defines the Save statistic as:
"A save is awarded to the relief pitcher who finishes a game for the winning team, under certain circumstances. A pitcher cannot receive a save and a win in the same game.

A relief pitcher recording a save must preserve his team's lead while doing one of the following:

1. Enter the game with a lead of no more than three runs and pitch at least one inning.
2. Enter the game with the tying run in the on-deck circle, at the plate or on the bases.
3. Pitch at least three innings."

However, we (Dylan Schneider and I) wanted to rework the Save statistic so that it include different degrees of saves. This idea came from the fact that pitchers are awarded saves in a number of different situations, some more difficult than others. We wanted to incorporate this into the statistic.
