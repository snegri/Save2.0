    "<p><font size=\"4\" color=\"black\">Under this definition of a save, all saves are created equal. For example, a pitcher who enters a game with a 3 run lead in the ninth inning gets the same stat boost as a pitcer who has to close out a game in the 7th inning, while only up by one run. Clearly, it is much harder to accomplish the ladder. Because of this, we wanted to create a statistic that rewards pithcers more for making more difficult saves.</font></p>\n"
